<h1 align=center style='text-align:center'>Taxi Company</h1>

Develop an application to manage a taxi company.<br>
All the classes must belong to package <b>taxi</b>. Use the class <b>MainClass</b> as an example.

<h2>R1. Companies and Taxi</h2>

A taxi company is represented by the class <b>TaxiCompany</b>.
<br/>

Taxis are represented by the class <b>Taxi</b>, that provides a constructor
accepting the unique id of the taxi.<br>

The method <b >toString</b>() from class <b>Taxi</b> returns the identifier of the taxi.<br/>

The method <b>addTaxi</b><b> </b>(<b>String</b><b> </b>id) from class <b>TaxiCompany</b>
allows adding a new item to the taxi list of a company; if the identifier is 
already present, it raises an <b>InvalidTaxiName</b> exception.<br/>

When a new taxi is added to a company, it is inserted at the end of the available taxis queue.<br/>

The method <b>getAvailable</b>() returns the free taxis queue.<br/>



<h2>R2. Places and Passengers</h2>

The class <b>Place</b> represents a real address and provides a constructor accepting as arguments the 
actual address and the relative district (or quarter) name.  
(E.g.: <code>"Corso Duca Abruzzi 24", "crocetta"</code>). <br>

The method <b>toString</b>() returns the address of the place.<br/>

The class <b>Passenger</b> represents a customer of the taxi company, it provides
a constructor accepting as argument the place where the customer is located currently, i.e.
where he/she should be picked up by a taxi<br/>

The method <b >getPlace</b>() returns the place where the passenger is currently located.<br/>



<h2>R3. Taxi Management</h2>

Taxi management will be handled with a First-In-First-Out strategy by means of a queue containing the available taxis.<br/>

The method <b>callTaxi</b>(<b >Passenger</b> p) assigns the first taxi in the available queue
to the passenger passed as argument and returns the taxi itself;
if no taxi is available then the call is lost.<br/>

The method <b>getLostTrips</b>() returns the total number of lost calls.<br/>

The class <b>Taxi</b> provides the methods for initiating and terminating a taxi trip:<br/>

<ul>
<li> a taxi, once assigned to a passenger, can initiate its trip by means of method 
	<b>beginTrip</b>(<b >Place</b> dest), that accepts the destination as argument,
	while the departure place is represented by the current passenger position.<p>

<li> the trip terminates with the method <b>terminateTrip()</b> that assigns to the
	passenger the destination place and puts the taxi at the end of the available taxis queue.
</ul>

<h2>R4. Trips</h2>

The class <b>Trip</b> represents a trip completed by a taxi.

The method <b>toString</b>() returns a string containing the departure and
arrival addresses, separated by a comma (<code>','</code>).
<br/>

The method <b>getTrips</b>(<b>String</b><b> </b>id) of the class TaxiCompany returns a list
containing all the trips completed by the taxi identified by the argument in chronological order;
if the identifier is not present in the list of taxis working for the company
then it raises an <b>InvalidTaxiName</b> exception.<br/> 


<h2>R5. Statistics</h2>

Class <b>TaxiCompany</b> provides two methods used to retrieve statistics:
<br/>
<ul>
<li>the method <b>statsTaxi()</b> returns the list of taxis (through the interface <b>InfoI</b>) sorted
    by decreasing number of completed trips (those for which the terminateTrip() method has been invoked);
    in case of tie use the alphabetic order of the id.<p>

<li>the method <b>statsDistricts()</b> returns the list of districts that have been destination of
	at least a trip (through the interface InfoI), sorted by decreasing number of trips
	having that district as the destination; in case of ties use the alphabetic order of
	the district.
</ul>
